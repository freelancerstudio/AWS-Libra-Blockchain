# Libra Blockchain on AWS Cloud

## Introduction && Housekeeping
The goal of this Project is to get Blockchain Developers, Architects, Professional Services Consultants, Enthusiasts and anyone else interested in the Libra Blockchain started on experimentation with it on AWS. To find out more about the Libra Project you can check out the [Libra Github](https://github.com/libra/libra), [Libra Developer Website](https://developers.libra.org/docs/libra-protocol) or the [Libra Community Boards](https://community.libra.org/) to get yourself further familiarized with core concepts, theory and walkthroughs.

A lot of the material here is sourced directly from the [My First Transaction](https://developers.libra.org/docs/my-first-transaction) walkthrough, but I have re-ordered and added clarification / my own flavor where I felt necessary. Some of the documentation is scattered on different pages, and are not easily searchable, so hopefully this Project will alleviate some of that pain. The overall goal is centered around creating a Local Testnet and running your tests there - whether it is transactions, minting, Move Smart Contracts or eventually RESTful API operations to build Mobile Apps, PWAs, etc.

## Project Phases

- **Phase 1**: My First Transaction (on Cloud9)
  - This Phase will take you through configuring the Amazon Cloud9 IDE to interact with the Libra Blockchain, connect into the Public Testnet and execute some basic Libra CLI Commands to get your familiarized with Libra

- **Phase 2**: Private Libra Blockchain Network
  - This Phase will introduce you to provisioning infrastructure needed to support a localized Testnet, how to connect Remote Clients into it, and how to execute additional Libra CLI Commands. This will allow you to undergo rigorous testing in a controlled environment versus using the Public Testnet.

## Next Steps

***NOTE*** *This Project is a continuous work-in-progress, the format and grammatical structure will change almost daily for a while before everything is set. I will also be adding additional content in the forms of tutorials, helper scripts, infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, CloudFormation) configuration files, and hopefully RESTful API and Serverless Technologies to further expand on the capabilites of the Libra Blockchain*
